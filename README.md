## Introduction

Makaan is a popular real estate website that lists properties for sale and rent across various locations. Web scraping allows us to automatically gather data from the website, which can be useful for market research, analysis, or other real estate-related purposes.

This project uses Python and several libraries to perform web scraping. The primary library used for web scraping is `BeautifulSoup`, which is a powerful library for extracting information from HTML and XML documents. Additionally, we use the `requests` library to fetch the website's content.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/makaan-real-estate-scraper.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd makaan-real-estate-scraper
```

To install the required Python dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start scraping real estate data from Makaan, you need to provide the URL of the Makaan search results page you want to scrape. You can customize the search filters on the website (e.g., location, budget, property type) to narrow down the search results.

In the `makaan_scraper.py` script, modify the `URL` variable with the desired Makaan search results URL:

```python
URL = "https://www.makaan.com/your-search-url"
```

After setting the URL, you can run the scraper using the following command:

```
python makaan_scraper.py
```

The script will fetch the data from the Makaan website, extract the relevant information, and store it in a CSV file named `makaan_data.csv`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
makaan-real-estate-scraper/
|-- makaan_scraper.py
|-- requirements.txt
|-- README.md
```

- `makaan_scraper.py`: The main Python script responsible for scraping the Makaan website and saving the data to a CSV file.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains a list of Python packages required for the project. You can install them using `pip`.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project and its usage.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `requests`: Used for fetching the HTML content of the website.
- `beautifulsoup4`: Used for parsing the HTML content and extracting relevant data.
- `pandas`: Used for organizing and saving the data in a structured format.

Make sure to install these libraries before running the script using the command mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.
